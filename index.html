            Zimbabwe is located in Southern Africa, bordered by South Africa to the south, Botswana to the southwest, Zambia to the north, and Mozambique to the east. The country has a diverse geography, ranging from the Eastern Highlands in the east to the low-lying areas in the north and west. Major geographic features include the Victoria Falls, Zambezi River, and Lake Kariba along the northern border with Zambia. Victoria Falls, located on the border with Zambia, is a major drawcard for visitors, offering activities like whitewater rafting, bungee jumping, and helicopter rides.
